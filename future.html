                    <h1>My future with computing</h1>
                    <p>I'm interested by Robotics, Software dev and Game dev. In the future, if possible I would like to work in the game dev industry 
                        but i'm worried about the salary or job availability so I decided to have Software development as a fallback.
                        <br>I do not have any grand dreams, I only wish for a decent salary and a comfortable life.
