                    <h1>Personal Reflection</h1>
                    <p>I'm glad with what I've done for my website's overall design. Everything is where it is supposed to be, the fact that it is responsive is also good.
                        <br> I think I did everything I could to make my website as good as it is right now and I do not know if there is something that needs improvement as I am already satisfied with 
                        how my website turned out. However I am only talking about the design, I have some ideas of things that I could add using javascript but it is not required by the assignment.
                        <br> I may implement this idea in my free time for my own enjoyment. 
                    </p>
                    <h1>Technical Aspects</h1>
                    <p>I have used Flexbox in order to make my website responsive. There are currently three boxes inside the flexbox container two which are invisible and the main box which has all the content.
                        <br>The two invisible boxes are positionned at the top and at the bottom of the main box, they are used for keeping the box shadow of the main box from going through the top of the page so 
                        their are only here for aesthetic purposes.
                        <br> As for the website's structure it is a basic structure where there is a navigation bar to go from page to page.
                        <br> For the CSS selectors and Ids, I chose most of them for aesthetic purposes, to change font colour, to change size, to align content. An exemple of Id that I used would be the 
                        "current" Id  which shows the page you are on currently by indicating it with a blueviolet colour in the navigation bar. I chose to use this as an Id because it is used only once in each pages.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Aesthetics</h1>
                    <p>My website is meant to look like a window from a NES game so I used a Pixelated font and only lines to separate the navigation bar from the rest of the page.
                        <br> I got my inspiration from two specific games, Mother 2 also known as Earthbound and TokiMeki Memorial. I based the background on Tokimeki Memorial's background and
                        the window aesthetics on Earthbound's window.
                        <br> The navigation bar is also interactive, as when the cursor hovers on one of the links, the background lights up and the text is underlined. The current page is also 
                        indicated by the link  with a blueviolet colour.   
                    </p>
                    <h1>Accessibility Aspects</h1>
                    <p>Here are some features of my website that are designed for accessibility :</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Responsivity</span> : My website is responsive so it can be seen by both normal sized screen and small sized screen.</li>
                        <li><span>Vision impaired friendly</span> : My website has alt text associated with the pictures for those who have to use screen readers.</li>
                    </ul>
